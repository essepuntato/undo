    <dc:description xml:lang="en">This class is based on a particular ontology pattern called Time-indexed Value in Context (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc). It has been used by several ontologies for describing values that can be assigned/held by an entity at different times and according to different contexts. Notable ontologies that are using it are the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO, http://purl.org/spar/pro) and the Publishing Status Ontology (PSO, http://purl.org/spar/pso).

    <dc:description xml:lang="en">The parliamentary, normative and legal documents published by the United Nations system (hereafter "UN documents"), contain many references to real-world objects and concepts, such as: other documents, people, organisations, legal terms, and roles. These objects and concepts, called in general terms “entities”, are related with the actual content of the document, even by means of different terms being the UN documents often issued in several official languages.

The United Nations System Document Ontology (UNDO, GitHub repository available at https://github.com/essepuntato/undo) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims at providing a framework for the description of all these entities and the relations that can exists among them in UN documents. The rationale behind the development of this model is to provide a common framework to be used by the various United Nations organisations for sharing data about documents and their content in RDF format.

Currently, UNDO is able to describe the following entities:

* documents and their versions (e.g. in different languages);
* several relevant document types, organised in a taxonomy;
* relations, with the possibility of defining their semantics dynamically (outside the scope of the TBox of the ontology) as individual of the class defining concepts;
* annotations, in order to link any RDF description to a particular document;
* terms, i.e. tokens as they can appear in a text;
* concepts, i.e. any notion or idea that can be used to provide a meaning to terms and a specific semantics to relations;
* values that can change in time and context (such as agents’ roles and document statuses);
* workflows and their executions.

The following figure contains a [Graffoo diagram](http://www.essepuntato.it/graffoo) that provides an overview of the class and properties introduced in UNDO.

![A Graffoo diagram of UNDO](undo.png)

The current version of the ontology imports several ontologies:

* [ALLOT](https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot) provides a formal implementation of Akoma Ntoso Top Level Classes (TLCs) in OWL 2 DL, so as to make available a vocabulary for enabling the integration of heterogeneous legal knowledge-bases based on Akoma Ntoso documents;

* [Publishing Workflow Ontology](http://purl.org/spar/pwo) provides a framework for characterising the main stages in the workflow associated with the publication of a document;

* [Time-indexed Value in Context](http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc) is an ontology pattern that allows one to describe scenarios in which someone (e.g., a person) has a value (e.g., a particular role) during a particular time and for a particular context;

* [Time Interval](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl) is an ontology pattern that enables the description of period of times characterised by a starting date and an ending date;

* [Web Annotation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/ns/oa) is a set of RDF classes, predicates and named entities that are used by the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) for creating annotations in RDF;

In addition to these ontologies, UNDO is also aligned with entities defined in external ontologies and vocabularies, in particular:

* [Dublin Core Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/) is an ontology implementing all the metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, including properties, vocabulary encoding schemes, syntax encoding schemes, and classes;

* [FaBiO](http://purl.org/spar/fabio) is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours;

* [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) is an ontology for describing people and their relations with other people, documents, and other information objects;

* [FRBR DL](http://purl.org/spar/frbr) is an expression in OWL 2 DL of the basic concepts and relations described in the IFLA report on the [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records), also described in [Ian Davis's RDF vocabulary](http://vocab.org/frbr/core);

* [ISO 639-1](http://id.loc.gov.vocabulary/iso693-1) is a vocabulary describing the first part of the ISO 639 international-standard language-code family;

* [LKIF Core: Action](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/action.owl) is an ontology for representing actions in general, i.e. processes which are performed by some agent;

* [LKIF Core: Role](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/role.owl) is an ontology for describing typology of roles (epistemic roles, functions, person roles, organisation roles);

* [PRO](http://purl.org/spar/pro) is an ontology describing possible roles in the publication process, or in other scholarly activities or situations, held by particular agent;

* [PSO](http://purl.org/spar/pso) is an ontology for characterizing the publication status of a document or other publication entity at each of the various stages in the publishing process;

* [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web.

A full version of UNDO, where all the aforementioned ontologies have been imported formally within the ontology, is available at https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo-imports, so as to enable advanced automatic reasoning and classification.

The next subsections provide a quick overview of all the entities defined, some exemple of usage, and the query that UNDO can answer.

### Documents and their versions

These entities and relations introduced in any UN document are implicitly defined by the content of the document in consideration, and typically can relate to (at least) one of the following layers:

* document-oriented layer, which allows the creation of direct links (via `allot:mentions`) from a document (`undo:Document`) or a specific version of it (`undo:DocumentVersion`) to other relevant entities that are mentioned within;
* entity-oriented layer, which enables the identification of entities cited in the document content (e.g. organisations) acting with other relevant entities (people, events, organizations, etc.), described by the class `undo:Relation`;
* content-oriented layer, which provides a specific semantics (via `undo:hasRelatedConcept`) to all the terms (`allot:Term`) identified in the document content.
In addition, each document (or any of its parts) can be explicitly annotated (using instances of `undo:Annotation`) by someone with all these relations in order to create a formal connection between the text and the entities its introduces.


### Time and context

Several kinds of objects can be involved in situations (`undo:ValueInTimeAndContext`) describing them as holding a certain value (`tvc:withValue`) associated for a specific interval (tvc:atTime) or according to a specific context (`tvc:withinContext`). For instance, agents having a particular role (e.g. being the President of Italy from 2006 to 2015) or documents holding particular status (e.g. a document that has been under-review from September 2016 to October 2016) in a specific time and/or related to a particular context are good examples for these situations.

These kinds of scenario involve at least four specific kinds of entities:

* the entity holding such value (e.g. an agent or a document);
* the value held (e.g. a role or a status);
* the time defining when such value is held (e.g. from 2006 to 2015);
* the context to which the scenario applies (Italy).


### Workflows and their executions

Keeping track of the processes concerning the creation and modification of documents is a crucial task in the legal and legislative domain. Each of these processes, commonly called workflows, is actually composed by a sequence of steps. Each step is responsible to produce some outputs (e.g. a review) starting from some inputs (e.g. a document). 
Workflows can be described from two different points of view. On the one hand, there is the declaration of the workflow schema, or simply the workflow (`undo:Workflow`), which is how a specific process (e.g. the publication of a document) is actually organised in sequential steps (`undo:Step`), each having a specific type (e.g. write, review, revise), involving different kinds of actors, and producing, in the end, a particular output. On the other hand, each particular execution of a workflow (`undo:WorkflowExecution`) is a specific entity per se. It is usually composed by sets of actions (`undo:Action`), and each set of actions is addressing a particular step defined in the workflow in consideration.



### Example of use

UNDO can be used for modelling several scenarios that are typical to the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar instantiations. 

The prefixes that are used in all the examples provided below are defined as follows:

#### Scenario 1

In the preface of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996 there are references to:

1. the UN resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. the Government of Turkey;
3. the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

#### Scenario 2

According to the content of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996, the General Assembly:

1. recalls the resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey;
3. notes the progress that has been made so far in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

#### Scenario 3

The UN resolution A/RES/50/100 has been published in six different languages. The term "decides" has been used twice in the English version, and, in parallel, the term "decide" has been used twice in the Spanish version. Both the terms actually refers to the same higher-level concept of taking a decision, even if this aspect has not been made formally explicit in the document itself.

#### Scenario 4

Giorgio Napolitano has been President of Italy for the first time from the 15th of May 2006 to the 22th of April 2013, when he resigned. He has been elected again on the 22th of April 2013, and he has been President of Italy for the second time by the 14th of January 2015, when he resigned for the second time. He has been substituted by Sergio Mattarella, who starts his mandate as President of Italy on the 3rd of February 2015, formerly judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from the 11th of October 2011 to the 2nd of February 2015.

#### Scenario 5

A document has been in drafting from the 14th of May to the 14th of June 2016. Then, it has been under revision for the following two months, and finally published on the 1st of September 2016.

```

:in-drafting a undo:Status .

:under-revision a undo:Status .

:published a undo:Status .
```

#### Scenario 6

The publication of a document should go through four phases, or steps: 

1. writing, which will produce a document;
2. review, that will produce comments starting from the input document;
3. revision, that will produce a new version of the previous document corrected considering the comments produced by the previous step; 
4. publication, which will assign the "published" status to that document. 

```

#### Scenario 7

The Assistant of the Italian Representative writes the first draft of a resolution from the 1st of March 2017 to the 5th of March 2017. On the 7th of March, the Italian Representative revises it, and extends the introduction. From the 9th of March to the 10th of March, Assistant of the Italian Representative finalises the document. On the 11th of March, the State Member Italy makes it available for review.

On the 12th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly read the draft. From the 13th of March to the 20th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly writes a comment highlighting issues. The comment is then made available to the President of the General Assembly on the 21st of March.

From the 22nd to the 27th of March, the Committee Number 1 revises the draft and addresses the main issues raised by the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly. On the 28th, the draft is sent to the General Assembly.

The General Assembly approves and publishes the resolution on the 31st of March.

### Competency questions

UNDO can be used for answering several questions related to the content of the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar SPARQL queries. 

The prefixes that are used in all the SPARQL queries provided below are defined as follows:

    PREFIX : &lt;https://w3id.org/akn/data/undo/&gt;
    PREFIX allot: &lt;https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/&gt;
    PREFIX oa: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#&gt;
    PREFIX owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;
    PREFIX undo: &lt;https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo/&gt;
    PREFIX ti: &lt;http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl#&gt;
    PREFIX tvc: &lt;http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/&gt;
