Such entities are linked with the actual content of the document, even by means of different terms being the UN documents often issued in several official languages.

The HLCM Working Group on Document Standards was tasked to define a common set of guidelines for the semantic mark-up of UN documents based on the [Akoma Ntoso standard](http://akomantoso.org) of the LegalDocumentML Technical Committee of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), which has defined an open document standard for parliamentary, legislative, administrative, executive, and judicial documents.

The Akoma Ntoso ontology is centred on the concept of document, which is considered in a very precise way through the specification of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) standard of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). The Akoma Ntoso ontology structure is divided in two main categories:

* document classes: focused on all entities that represent the different aspects of a document as intellectual creation, the forms (versions, translations, etc.) that it may take and its physical embodiment (PDF, XML, HTML, paper, etc.);

* non-document classes: focused on two different aspects, namely who is responsible for the production of the content (organization, person, etc.) and what the content is about (concept, object, event, locations, roles, deliberation steps, etc.).

For the document classes Akoma Ntoso has defined a set of prescriptive / canonical classes and sub-classes modelled on the FRBR conceptualization of documents. These classes are referred by with specific XML tags (prefixed by “FRBR”) in Akoma Ntoso documents. For non-document classes of parliamentary and legal matters, the Akoma Ntoso specifications rather than defining the ontology, which could be overly wide and all-encompassing due to rather huge and all-encompassing issues that legal and parliamentary documents deal with, specify a very broad set of general guidelines that an ontology should conform to in order to be used in conjunction with Akoma Ntoso documents. These informal guidelines are referred by with specific XML tags (prefixed by “TLC”) in Akoma Ntoso documents, each referring to a particular informal top level class (TLC), i.e. that is not defined by means of a formal language such as logics.

The United Nations System Document Ontology (UNDO, https://w3id.org/un/ontology/undo) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims at providing a framework for the formal description of all entities and the relations that can exist among them in UN Documents, description that is not provided by Akoma Ntoso. The idea behind the development of this model is to have a mechanism for sharing data about documents and their content in RDF format in an interchangeable way and, eventually, extended by the various agencies of the United Nations to meet their own domain specific requirements.

It is worth mentioning that UNDO and the [official UN document describing it](https://w3id.org/un/document/undo) are living artefacts, and they have been drafted in the context of the HLCM Working Group on Document Standards under the technical supervision of [Silvio Peroni](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-4305). They will be subject to regular updates to incorporate new developments and requirements.

Currently, UNDO is able to describe the following entities:

* documents and their versions (e.g. in different languages);

* several relevant document types, organized in a taxonomy;

* mentions to specific entities introduced in documents;

* relations among entities (i.e. both documents and the entities they mention);

* annotations, in order to link any RDF description to a particular document;

* terms, i.e. tokens as they can appear in a text, and their semantics;

* values that can change in time and context (such as agents’ roles and document statuses);

* workflows and their executions. 

The following figure contains a [Graffoo diagram](http://www.essepuntato.it/graffoo) that provides an overview of the class and properties introduced in UNDO.

![A Graffoo diagram of UNDO](undo.png)

The current version of the ontology imports several ontologies:

* [ALLOT](https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot) provides a formal implementation of Akoma Ntoso Top Level Classes (TLCs) in OWL 2 DL, so as to make available a vocabulary for enabling the integration of heterogeneous legal knowledge-bases based on Akoma Ntoso documents;

* [Publishing Workflow Ontology](http://purl.org/spar/pwo) provides a framework for characterising the main stages in the workflow associated with the publication of a document;

* [Time-indexed Value in Context](http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc) is an ontology pattern that allows one to describe scenarios in which someone (e.g., a person) has a value (e.g., a particular role) during a particular time and for a particular context;

* [Time Interval](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl) is an ontology pattern that enables the description of period of times characterised by a starting date and an ending date;

* [Web Annotation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/ns/oa) is a set of RDF classes, predicates and named entities that are used by the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) for creating annotations in RDF;

In addition to these ontologies, UNDO is also aligned with entities defined in external ontologies and vocabularies, in particular:

* [Dublin Core Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/) is an ontology implementing all the metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, including properties, vocabulary encoding schemes, syntax encoding schemes, and classes;

* [FaBiO](http://purl.org/spar/fabio) is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours;

* [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) is an ontology for describing people and their relations with other people, documents, and other information objects;

* [FRBR DL](http://purl.org/spar/frbr) is an expression in OWL 2 DL of the basic concepts and relations described in the IFLA report on the [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records), also described in [Ian Davis's RDF vocabulary](http://vocab.org/frbr/core);

* [ISO 639-1](http://id.loc.gov.vocabulary/iso693-1) is a vocabulary describing the first part of the ISO 639 international-standard language-code family;

* [LKIF Core: Action](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/action.owl) is an ontology for representing actions in general, i.e. processes which are performed by some agent;

* [LKIF Core: Role](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/role.owl) is an ontology for describing typology of roles (epistemic roles, functions, person roles, organisation roles);

* [PRO](http://purl.org/spar/pro) is an ontology describing possible roles in the publication process, or in other scholarly activities or situations, held by particular agent;

* [PSO](http://purl.org/spar/pso) is an ontology for characterizing the publication status of a document or other publication entity at each of the various stages in the publishing process;

* [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web.

A full version of UNDO, where all the aforementioned ontologies have been imported formally within the ontology, is available at https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo-imports, so as to enable advanced automatic reasoning and classification.

In addition, it is also aligned to two important foundational ontologies, i.e. the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2.0/bfo.owl) and the [Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE)](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl). This alignment is crucial since it enables a reusability of the model in different contexts and domains (e.g. BFO is already used in several models adopted by the United Nations), and it also provides a methodological organization of all the entities introduced in UNDO.

The next subsections provide a quick overview of all the entities defined, some exemple of usage, and the query that UNDO can answer.

### Documents and their versions

Several existing models have tried to explain the difference between documents and their versions. By means of ALLOT – which in turn uses a well-known and robust model for characterizing bibliographic metadata, the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) – UNDO separates documents (e.g. UN resolution A/RES/50/100) and versions (e.g. language versions) in two specific and distinct layers, characterized by two classes: `undo:Document` and `undo:DocumentVersion`. 

On the one hand, following the FRBR classification, the former class maps on the FRBR Work level, and it describes the document essence, independently from the revisions and/or translations that can characterizes it in time. On the other hand, the class for document versions maps on the FRBR Expression level, and it is used for pointing to specific realizations of a document characterized by a particular and fixed content. For instance, a draft in English, an amended version of that draft, a translation in French are all different versions (i.e. FRBR Expressions) of the same document (i.e. FRBR Work).

There are four properties available in UNDO that can be used for defining relations among these classes:

* property `allot:hasRealization`, which links a document with its versions;

* property `frbr:revision`, which links a specific version to another version of it (e.g. a draft that has been amended and revised) –  it is possible to add appropriate information concerning which document produced the revision, when the new revision is effective, and the list of the revisions produced by means of some of the models that have been aligned/imported by UNDO, i.e. PWO and FaBiO;

* property `dcterms:language`, which allows one to specify the language associated to the specific version in consideration – the link between translations in different languages can be linked by means of the property `frbr:translation` defined in FRBR DL to which UNDO aligns;

* property `frbr:transformation`, used for describing documents that are transformed somehow in another original document (even of another type – see the following section) in a sufficient degree to warrant their being considered as new works (e.g. when the General Assembly publish a new resolution from a draft provided by someone).

It is worth mentioning that, in case it is needed, the characterization of the document components should be handled by means of the Document Components Ontology (DoCO, http://purl.org/spar/doco).


### Document types

While, on the one hand, the dichotomy between documents and their versions is an important aspect to address, on the other hand it is also crucial to provide an appropriate taxonomy of defining document types, so as to allow one to describe them appropriately. In UNDO, the class `undo:Document` includes several subclasses taking care of providing appropriate descriptions for the main United Nations documents (`undo:Resolution`, `undo:Constitution`, `undo:Standard`, etc.). Each document type is accompanied by a natural language description clarifying its role.


### Documents mentioning other entities

The parliamentary, normative and legal documents published by the United Nations System of Organizations are full of references to real-world objects and concepts, such as other documents, people, organizations, legal terms, and roles. UNDO makes available the property `allot:mentions` for linking a document (or one specific version of it) to a particular entity (defined by the class `allot:Reference`) that is mentioned within (e.g. that the resolution A/RES/50/100 mentions the Government of Turkey). This property allows one to build a sophisticated network of references to entities that enables the cross-navigation between documents and other related resources.


### Relations

While the aforementioned property is important, on the one hand, it does not allow one to specify the particular semantics justifying a particular mention of an entity in a document – e.g., recalling the example in the previous section, the reasons why the resolution A/RES/50/100 mentions the Government of Turkey. On the other hand, other relevant relations between non-document entities, that are by reading the natural language argumentations carried by the document content, cannot be described – e.g. the sentence of the aforementioned resolution where “the General Assembly reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey”. Since it is not possible to define all the kinds of relations that could be hidden behind the content of any United Nations document, UNDO makes available a mechanism for defining such relations in a flexible way without changing the actual terminological specification of the ontology, i.e. its TBox.

Thus we have chosen to define relations between entities by means of a particular class, i.e. `undo:Relation`, so as to enable the specification of the semantics of such relations by using individuals of the class `allot:Concept`. This approach is quite robust, since if one need a new semantics for a relation s/he has only to add a new individual to the class allot:Concept, thus modifying only the ABox of the ontology and, implicitly, reducing the chances of introducing inconsistencies. In addition, this approach is very flexible, since it allows one to extend the set of relations applicable between entities every time there is a specific need.

In particular, the properties that can be used with the instances of the class undo:Relation are introduced as follows:

* the property `undo:hasProponent`, which is used for identifying the subject entity of a relation (e.g. the “General Assembly” described in the sentence “the General Assembly reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey”);

* the property `undo:hasReceiver`, which is used for identifying the object entity of a relation (e.g. the “Government of Turkey”, in the previous example);

* the property `undo:hasSemantics`, which is used for specifying the particular concept defining the semantics of the relation.


### Annotations to documents

By reading a document content, several people can derive different (even contrasting) interpretations upon the same text. For instance, the same sentence, e.g. “Encourages all relevant non-governmental organizations […] to participate in and contribute to the Conference” can be read as an invitation or as a reproach for having not doing any action yet. Therefore, it is important to have some mechanism for allowing the existence of all these different interpretations in a way that is understandable and still consistent from an ontological perspective.

For this reason, UNDO reuses the framework defined in the Web Annotation Ontology that allows one to annotate documents (or even portions of them) by means of another entity, such as a relation as introduced in the previous subsection. In particular, every annotation in UNDO is defined as an individual of the class undo:Annotation, and the following properties are used to linking an entity to the document its annotate:

* the property `oa:hasBody` is used to specify the body of the annotation to be attached to the document;

* the property `oa:hasTarget` is used to indicate the particular document (described according to any of the available FRBR levels) to which the annotation is specified.

In addition, each document (or any of its parts) can be explicitly annotated (using instances of `undo:Annotation`) by someone with all these relations in order to create a formal connection between the text and the entities its introduces.


### Terms and their semantics

Broadly speaking, terms are words or groups of words whose meanings are defined in a formal and precise manner by means of specific concepts. Thus, terms can refer to nouns (e.g. “computer keyboard”), verbs (e.g. “decide”), persons (e.g. “John”), cities (e.g. “New York”), etc., they can share the same textual content while being polysemous (e.g. the city “Paris” and the person “Paris”), they can refer to the same meaning (e.g. the third person verb “decides” in English and its related in Spanish, “decide”), and so on.

In UNDO the class `allot:Term` is used to define terms, while the property `undo:hasRelatedConcept` enables one to link a term to the concept (introduced by the class `allot:Concept`) defining the meaning of the term in consideration.


### Values, time and context
Several kinds of objects can be involved in situations (undo:ValueInTimeAndContext) describing them as holding a certain value (tvc:withValue) associated for a specific interval (tvc:atTime) or according to a specific context (tvc:withinContext). For instance, agents having a particular role (e.g. being the President of the United Nations General Assembly for the whole 2016) or documents holding particular status (e.g. a document that has been under-review from September 2016 to October 2016) in a specific time and/or related to a particular context are examples for these situations.

In UNDO these situations can be described by means of the class `undo:ValueInTimeAndContext`, which introduces the framework defined by the Time-indexed Value in Time (TVC) ontology pattern for defining in details all the aforementioned temporal and contextual aspects. In particular, it allows one to specify:

* the entity holding such value (e.g. an agent or a document) by means of the property `tvc:hasValue`;

* the value held (e.g. a role or a status) by means of the property `tvc:withValue`;

* the time defining when such value is held (e.g. from 2006 to 2015) using the property `tvc:atTime`;

* the context to which the scenario applies (e.g. the United Nations General Assembly) using the property `tvc:withinContext`.


### Workflows and their executions

Keeping track of the processes concerning the creation and modification of documents is a crucial task to address in the legal and legislative domain. Each of these processes, commonly called workflow, is actually composed by a sequence of steps. Each step is responsible to produce some outputs (e.g. a review) starting from some inputs (e.g. a document). 

In UNDO, workflows can be described from two different points of view, by reusing the framework implemented in the Publishing Workflow Ontology (PWO). On the one hand, there is the declaration of the workflow schema, or simply the workflow (`undo:Workflow`), which is how a specific process (e.g. the publication of a document) is organized in sequential steps (`undo:Step`), where each step:

* has a specific type (property `undo:hasStepType`);

* needs some input (property `pwo:needs`);

* produces a particular output (property `pwo:produces`). 

On the other hand, each particular execution of a workflow (undo:WorkflowExecution) is a specific entity per se, it is usually composed by sets of actions (undo:Action), and each action:

* addresses (part of) a particular step defined in the workflow in consideration (property taskex:executesTask);

* involves entities as participants (`part:hasParticipant`);

* is executed within a particular interval (`pwo:happened`).

It is worth mentioning that this module of UNDO is able to describe the full characterization that Akoma Ntoso provides in its specification about document workflows and lifecycles –  the latter by means of the class `undo:Lifecycle`.



### Example of use

UNDO can be used for modelling several scenarios that are typical to the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar instantiations.

#### Scenario 1

In the preface of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996 there are references to:

1. the UN resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. the Government of Turkey;
3. the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

```

#### Scenario 2

According to the content of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996, the General Assembly:

1. recalls the resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey;
3. notes the progress that has been made so far in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

#### Scenario 3

The UN resolution A/RES/50/100 has been published in six different languages. The term "decides" has been used twice in the English version, and, in parallel, the term "decide" has been used twice in the Spanish version. Both the terms actually refers to the same higher-level concept of taking a decision, even if this aspect has not been made formally explicit in the document itself.

#### Scenario 4

Giorgio Napolitano has been President of Italy for the first time from the 15th of May 2006 to the 22th of April 2013, when he resigned. He has been elected again on the 22th of April 2013, and he has been President of Italy for the second time by the 14th of January 2015, when he resigned for the second time. He has been substituted by Sergio Mattarella, who starts his mandate as President of Italy on the 3rd of February 2015, formerly judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from the 11th of October 2011 to the 2nd of February 2015.

#### Scenario 6

The publication of a document should go through four phases, or steps: 

1. writing, which will produce a document;
2. review, that will produce comments starting from the input document;
3. revision, that will produce a new version of the previous document corrected considering the comments produced by the previous step; 
4. publication, which will assign the "published" status to that document.

#### Scenario 7

The Assistant of a Representative writes the first draft of a resolution from the 1st of March 2017 to the 5th of March 2017. On the 7th of March, the Representative revises it, and extends the introduction. From the 9th of March to the 10th of March, Assistant of the Representative finalises the document. On the 11th of March, the State Member makes it available for review.

On the 12th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly read the draft. From the 13th of March to the 20th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly writes a comment highlighting issues. The comment is then made available to the President of the General Assembly on the 21st of March.

From the 22nd to the 27th of March, the Committee Number 1 revises the draft and addresses the main issues raised by the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly. On the 28th, the draft is sent to the General Assembly.

The General Assembly approves and publishes the resolution on the 31st of March.

### Competency questions

UNDO can be used for answering several questions related to the content of the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar SPARQL queries. 

The prefixes that are used in all the SPARQL queries provided below are defined as follows:

    PREFIX : &lt;https://w3id.org/akn/data/undo/&gt;
    PREFIX allot: &lt;https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/&gt;
    PREFIX oa: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#&gt;
    PREFIX owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt;

It has been used by several ontologies for describing values that can be assigned/held by an entity at different times and according to different contexts. Notable ontologies that are using it are the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO, http://purl.org/spar/pro) and the Publishing Status Ontology (PSO, http://purl.org/spar/pso).
