Notable ontologies that are using it are the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO, http://purl.org/spar/pro) and the Publishing Status Ontology (PSO, http://purl.org/spar/pso).

    dc:description """The parliamentary, normative and legal documents published by the United Nations system of organisations, from now on "UN documents", are full of references to real-world objects and concepts, such as other documents, people, organisations, legal terms, and roles. Such entities are linked with the actual content of the document, even by means of different terms being the UN documents often issued in several official languages. 

The United Nations Document Ontology (UNDO, GitHub repository available at https://github.com/essepuntato/undo) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims at providing a framework for the description of all these entities and the relations that can exists among them. These entities and relations are, thus, implicitly defined by the content of the document in consideration, and typically can concern at least one of the following layers:

1. document-oriented layer, which allows the creation of direct links from a document (a resolution, a report, etc.) to other relevant entities that are mentioned within;
2. entity-oriented layer, which enables the identification of entities cited in the document content (e.g. organisations) acting with other relevant entities (people, events, organizations, etc.);
3. content-oriented layer, which provides a specific semantics to all the terms identified in the document content.
 
The document (or any of its parts) can be explicitly annotated by someone with all these relations in order to create a formal connection between the text and the entities its introduces.

The following figure contains a [Graffoo diagram](http://www.essepuntato.it/graffoo) that provides an overview of the class and properties introduced in UNDO.

![A Graffoo diagram of UNDO](undo.png)

The current version of the ontology imports several ontologies:

* [ALLOT](https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot) provides a formal implementation of Akoma Ntoso Top Level Classes (TLCs) in OWL 2 DL, so as to make available a vocabulary for enabling the integration of heterogeneous legal knowledge-bases based on Akoma Ntoso documents;

* [Time-indexed Value in Context](http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc) is an ontology pattern that allows one to describe scenarios in which someone (e.g., a person) has a value (e.g., a particular role) during a particular time and for a particular context;

* [Time Interval](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl) is an ontology pattern that enables the description of period of times characterised by a starting date and an ending date;

* [Web Annotation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/ns/oa) is a set of RDF classes, predicates and named entities that are used by the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) for creating annotations in RDF;

In addition to these ontologies, UNDO is also aligned with entities defined in external ontologies and vocabularies, in particular:

* [Dublin Core Metadata Terms](http://purl.org/dc/terms/) is an ontology implementing all the metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, including properties, vocabulary encoding schemes, syntax encoding schemes, and classes;

* [FaBiO](http://purl.org/spar/fabio) is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours;

* [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) is an ontology for describing people and their relations with other people, documents, and other information objects;

* [FRBR DL](http://purl.org/spar/frbr) is an expression in OWL 2 DL of the basic concepts and relations described in the IFLA report on the [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records), also described in [Ian Davis's RDF vocabulary](http://vocab.org/frbr/core);

* [ISO 639-1](http://id.loc.gov.vocabulary/iso693-1) is a vocabulary describing the first part of the ISO 639 international-standard language-code family;

* [LKIF Core: Action](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/action.owl) is an ontology for representing actions in general, i.e. processes which are performed by some agent;

* [LKIF Core: Role](http://www.estrellaproject.org/lkif-core/role.owl) is an ontology for describing typology of roles (epistemic roles, functions, person roles, organisation roles);

* [PRO](http://purl.org/spar/pro) is an ontology describing possible roles in the publication process, or in other scholarly activities or situations, held by particular agent;

* [PSO](http://purl.org/spar/pso) is an ontology for characterizing the publication status of a document or other publication entity at each of the various stages in the publishing process;

* [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web.

A full version of UNDO, where all the aforementioned ontologies have been imported formally within the ontology, is available at https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo-imports, so as to enable advanced automatic reasoning and classification.


### Example of use

UNDO can be used for modelling several scenarios that are typical to the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar instantiations. 

The prefixes that are used in all the examples provided below are defined as follows:

    @prefix : <https://w3id.org/akn/data/undo/> .
    @prefix undo: <https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo/> .
    @prefix allot: <https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/> .
    @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
    @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
    @prefix lan: <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/> .
    @prefix oa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#> .
    @prefix ti: <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/timeinterval.owl#> .
    @prefix tvc: <http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/> .



#### Scenario 1

In the preface of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996 there are references to:

1. the UN resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. the Government of Turkey;
3. the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

#### Scenario 2

According to the content of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996, the General Assembly:

1. recalls the resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey;
3. notes the progress that has been made so far in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).

#### Scenario 3

The UN resolution A/RES/50/100 has been published in six different languages. The term "decides" has been used twice in the English version, and, in parallel, the term "decide" has been used twice in the Spanish version. Both the terms actually refers to the same higher-level concept of taking a decision, even if this aspect has not been made formally explicit in the document itself.

#### Scenario 4

Giorgio Napolitano has been President of Italy for the first time from the 15th of May 2006 to the 22th of April 2013, when he resigned. He has been elected again on the 22th of April 2013, and he has been President of Italy for the second time by the 14th of January 2015, when he resigned for the second time. He has been substituted by Sergio Mattarella, who starts his mandate as President of Italy on the 3rd of February 2015, formerly judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from the 11th of October 2011 to the 2nd of February 2015.

### Competency questions

UNDO can be used for answering several questions related to the content of the documents published by the United Nations (e.g. UN Resolutions). In the following subsections we introduce some of them, and we accompany them with exemplar SPARQL queries. 

The prefixes that are used in all the SPARQL queries provided below are defined as follows:

    PREFIX : <https://w3id.org/akn/data/undo/>
    PREFIX allot: <https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/>
    PREFIX oa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#>
    PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
    PREFIX undo: <https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/undo/>

#### Question 1

What are all the documents that refer to the UN resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992?

    SELECT DISTINCT ?document
    WHERE {
        ?document allot:mentions :a-res-47-180-1992-12-22 .
    }


#### Question 2

What are all the entities referred by the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996?

    SELECT DISTINCT ?entity ?type
    WHERE {
        :a-res-50-100-1996-02-02 allot:mentions ?entity .
        ?entity a ?type .
        FILTER (?type != owl:NamedIndividual)
    }


#### Question 3

What are the documents that describes the General Assembly recalling the resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992?

    SELECT DISTINCT ?document
    WHERE {
        ?rel a undo:Relation ;
            undo:hasProponent :general-assembly ;
            undo:hasSemantics :recall ;
            undo:hasReceiver :a-res-47-180-1992-12-22 .
        
        ?ann a undo:Annotation ;
            oa:hasBody ?rel ;
            oa:hasTarget ?document
    }


#### Question 4

What are all the terms that actually refer to the concept of taking a decision, and in which documents have been used?

    SELECT DISTINCT ?term ?document
    WHERE {
        ?term a allot:Term ;
            undo:hasRelatedConcept :taking-a-decision .
